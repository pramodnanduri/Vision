## Inspiration
In pursuit of creating a social impact and to help the blind and visually impaired people, we created an app that helps the visually impaired detect obstacles ahead by forewarnings. 

## What it does
This is a completely voice based Android application, which detects the upcoming obstacles that are in front of the moving person and warns the person by Voice.
In addition to this, we have integrated the option to send the current location of the person via the SMS. 
 
## How we built it
1. Android SDKs.
2. Raspberry PI 
3. Ultrasonic sensor. 
4. Java, Python. 

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating the hardware for optimal accuracy. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have a perfectly working hardware that meets our goals and it is super easy to use. 

## What we learned
A lot.. :-) 

## What's next for Vision
Distinguish between faces and immovable objects that are coming ahead of us.
